## About

**SantosMods.dev** develops Grand Theft Auto V modifications with a focus on stability, structure, and long-term usability.

The goal is to create content that behaves consistently across different setups and can be used reliably over time, rather than quick or experimental releases.

Our work supports:
- Roleplay servers  
- Freeroam servers  
- Private servers  
- Singleplayer use  

---

## What We Make

### YMAPs
- Custom locations and environment reworks  
- Layouts designed to work with existing game systems  
- Careful prop usage to avoid unnecessary performance impact  

### Scripts
- Small, optional scripts used only where needed  
- Intended to support map behavior or simple interactions  

### Assets & Textures
- Limited environmental assets and textures  
- Used only when they improve clarity or consistency  

### EUP (Planned)
- Emergency Uniform Packs planned for future release  
- Development and distribution will be controlled  

---

## How We Work

- Focus on stability over features  
- Avoid unnecessary complexity  
- Prefer standalone resources  
- Structure content so it is easy to install, remove, or update  

We prioritize reliability and predictability.
