## Overview

**SantosMods.dev** is a policy-driven GTA V development organization focused on long-term stability, performance, and operational integrity.

Our work is engineered for **serious roleplay ecosystems**, emphasizing preventative design, strict enforcement, and infrastructure-grade deployment standards.

We do not chase features — we ship **durable systems**.

## Core Focus Areas

- **Stability-first YMAP development**  
  Optimized prop counts, clean navmeshes, and predictable streaming behavior.

- **Infrastructure-grade deployments**  
  Ubuntu-based environments, Node.js services, Pterodactyl orchestration, and hardened pipelines.

- **Internal tooling & enforcement systems**  
  Licensing validation, abuse detection, and controlled distribution at scale.

All releases are standalone, modular, and designed for **long-term server health**.

## Featured Project

- **UrbanPlus: World Reimagined**  
  A full-scale environmental overhaul built for realism, performance, and extensibility.
